/**
 * <p>
 * A buffered {@link Reader} that also gives a way to consume input line by
 * line like {@link BufferedReader} but with the line endings preserved.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Line endings are defined as <code>"\r\n"</code> (Windows-style), or
 * <code>"\r"</code> not followed by <code>"\n"</code> (Macintosh-style), or
 * <code>"\n"</code> not preceded by <code>"\r"</code> (Unix-style). The last
 * line returned will not have a line ending if the input does not end with one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class also gives a way to count lines as it goes, similarly to
 * {@link LineNumberReader}. The documentation of
 * {@link LineNumberReader#getLineNumber()} does not make it perfectly clear
 * that the line number being returned is that of the line most recently read,
 * but it is, and this is what this class does, via
 * {@link #getLineCount()}. That number is zero before any input is read and
 * remains the same after end of file as just before end of file, and in this
 * class comes from {@link #getLineCount()}. There is no equivalent to
 * {@link LineNumberReader#setLineNumber(int)} but it could be achieved with
 * a subclass.
 * </p>
