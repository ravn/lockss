This is the source tree for the LOCKSS daemon.
See http://www.lockss.org/ for information about the project.

Obtaining Source
----------------

The latest version of this code can be obtained via Subversion with

 svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/lockss/svn/lockss-daemon/trunk lockss-daemon

Prerequisites
-------------

Installed Packages:

- Sun JDK 7.  Java 8 is not yet supported.

- Ant 1.7.1 or greater.  (http://ant.apache.org/)

- Python 2.5 or greater (but not 3.x).

(On Debian or Ubuntu,
  apt-get install python sun-java6-jdk ant ant-optional
)

Other Prerequisites:

- Junit is included in the LOCKSS source distribution, but the Ant targets
  that invoke JUnit (test-xxx) require the JUnit jar to be on Ant's
  classpath.  The easiest way to do that is to copy lib/junit.jar into
  Ant's lib directory (<ant-install-dir>/ant/lib).

- For some of the tools the JAVA_HOME env var must be set to the directory
  in which the JDK is installed.  (I.e., it's expected that tools.jar can
  be found in ${JAVA_HOME}/lib)
