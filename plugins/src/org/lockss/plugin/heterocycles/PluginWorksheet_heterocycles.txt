-------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, filling in the answer to questions. Cut and paste specific URLs to support your notes and to allow subsequent readers to understand your analysis.---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: The Japan Institute of Heterocyclic ChemistryPublishing platform: uniqueRT: 4043RU:Plugin name suggestion:  org.lockss.plugin.heterocycles.ClockssHeterocyclesPluginClockss?

If so, where?* same as start url.How does the permission statement work? * text on html page:"CLOCKSS system has permission to ingest, preserve, and serve this Archival Unit. "Pick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) base_url: http://www.heterocycles.jp/   volume: 1b) base_url: http://www.heterocycles.jp/   volume 83c) base_url: http://www.heterocycles.jp/   volume 87-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Refetch Depth (default is 1)* I am unsure how to determine whether this publisher add items on aper-article or only on a per-issue basis. Looking at the three volume 1, 83,and 87, the issue number is increasing from 1 to 12 (perhaps more in other volume), and assumming that no new articles are added to old issues, I think the Refetch Depth should be 1.     Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predictable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc>/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.* <base_url>/clockss/libraries/journal/<volume_name>/    http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/libraries/journal/83/  <base_url>/clockss/downloads/(PDF|PDFwithLinks|PDFsi)/[^/]+/<volume_name>/    http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/downloads/PDF/23208/83/1    http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/downloads/PDFwithLinks/21577/83/1    http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/downloads/PDFsi/21702/83/7  <base_url>/clockss/libraries/fulltext/[^/]+/<volume_name>/    http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/libraries/fulltext/21568/83/1    what do we do about PDFwithLinks? Collect? Not collect?  ex: http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/downloads/PDFwithLinks/22960/87/1Journal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know):* does 'Home' button usually the Journal Front Page?http://www.heterocycles.jp/newlibrary/libraries/prepressVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url):* same as start url: http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/manifest/vol/87Issue Table of contents:* volume 87 issue 2http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/libraries/journal/87/2Abstract:* derived abstract from full-text url by replacing 'full-text' with 'abst'but can not find a link to abstract from full-text page  http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/libraries/fulltext/21568/83/1or issue table of contents:  http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/manifest/vol/83http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/libraries/abst/21568/83/1PDF* http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/downloads/PDF/23208/83/1PDFPLUS(May be called enhanced PDF. Look at a page - is it a PDF with active links or is it a PDF embedded within an html frame? Note this information)* pdfs with active links: http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/downloads/PDFwithLinks/21577/83/1PDF Landing Page(This is a page with information on it with a link to the PDF or to allow download of the PDF.

First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.http://www.heterocycles.jp/scimg/0/0000046858?style=opaque&width=500http://www.heterocycles.jp/clockss/img/cycle.gif  Are there multiple size options?   * no  Can it be opened in a popup?    * no  Does it open in its own page?   * no  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?   * no  Does it source from a different base url?   * noDOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)* no doi pattern, but can find some doi links in the References section asCrossRefa) http://dx.doi.org/10.3987/COM-03-9909b) http://dx.doi.org/10.3987/COM-00-9063c) http://dx.doi.org/10.3987/COM-02-9559Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Addition Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, cityedby, servlet, searchId, etc* not found  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).* not foundLinks to consider including  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base    underneath <base_url> and contains things like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)* not foundDoes this site use automatically generated content?? View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.* not foundNotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION-------------------------------------As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdfwhereas arguments that might be unnnecessary might look like this  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3nThese arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)- not found----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING---------------------------------------Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention. ------Look for these sorts of things. Remove this list and replace it with what you find---------  Name and/or logo of subscriber institution  <div id="header">	    Copyright on page showing year  Footer section including adds or date  <div id="footer">	And if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification datesfxlink javascript commands* not foundAnything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from.  deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them.* not applicable-----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?* no-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION------------------------------------Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.View the page source and search for the following "<meta" there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file (ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.  Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?* metadata not found.* suggestion for metadata request from the publisher. 1-15 are what I usuallyencounter:1.  publisher2.  proprietary_identifier/identifier/journal identifier3.  journal_title4.  article_title5.  author/creator/contributor6.  date/issued (format preferred 2010/5/12)7.  doi8.  issn9.  eissn10. end_page11. start_page12. keywords13. volume14. issue15. description16. issnl17. issnm18. isbn19. eisbn20. language21. format22. relation23. relation_ispartof24. rights25. source26. subject27. type
