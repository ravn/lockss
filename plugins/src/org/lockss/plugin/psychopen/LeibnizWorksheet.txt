---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: PsychOpen Publishing platform?: PsychOpen is a hardware and software solution for publications. But in the note on www.psychopen.eu/publish it says:"PsychOpen offers its journals a hardware and software platform and associated electronic publishing services free of charge, using the open-source Open Journal Systems (OJS) software. " so it is off of OJS2RT: 5460RU: 4737Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) PsychOpenPlugin or PsychOpenOJS2Plugin if we make it a childClockss? [yes/no]: yes		GLN? [yes/no]: noPLN?

If so, where?  The manifest pages have a LOCKSS permission statement (but not CLOCKSS).  Alternatively,   The permission is via open source creative commons license. There is the same listing in the footer of every page (volume toc, issue toc, article page).   HOWEVER - the creative commons reference does not contain the critical 'ref="license" that is needed. All pages have this:  <a title="This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License." href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">    <img src="/public/journals/1/images/CC_by.png" alt="Creative Commons License" />  </a>Pick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a)  http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/issue/view/8 (Interpersona, 2010, vol4, issue 2)b) http://ejop.psychopen.eu/issue/view/21 (Europe's Journal of Psychology, 2010,  vol6, issue 4)c) http://pch.psychopen.eu/issue/view/2 (Psychology, Community & Health, 2012, Vol 1, Issue 2)-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Crawl rules & Content LayoutJournal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)  http://pch.psychopen.eu/index.php/pch  http://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop  http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/index.php/interpersonaVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)  Currently only available as all issue page; Must request a true manifest page similar to other OJS2 pages.    http://ejop.psychopen.eu/issue/archive   request    http://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/gateway/lockss?year=%d" (to mimic existing ojs2 plugin)Issue Table of contents  http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/issue/view/10    The first part is consistent across all journals. The final number bears no correlation to anything. It is apparently just an incremented number but there are instances where it is is out of order. But it is unique within the journal.Article  Across all the current journals, each article has only an abstract, a pdf landing page (html frameset) and pdf. In addition there are links to allow access to the manifest information and citation info as well as a printable version of the abstract.  Abstract  http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/article/view/#   The number is just a unique identifier and has no meaning. This makes the URL's opaque. No correlation to volume/issue.   Extensive metadata is in html tags on this page.PDF   http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/article/viewFile/#/#       the first number corresponds to the number of the abstract. Second number may be the same or different. PDF Landing Page  http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/article/view/<#>/<#>    The two numbers may or may not be the same. Again, just unique identifiers. No correlation to page, etc.    This page is an html frameset that uses javascript and the pdfObject to show the pdf within the frame. FF doesn't handle this, Safari and Chrome do. It requires the Adobe Reader.     If the pdf doesn't show properly, you get an suggestion on how to fix and are given the option to download.    If the pdf does show properly, you get the option for a fullscreen view.    In all cases you also get a download link.    Extensive metadata is available on this pageFull text HTML    N/APrint friendly version option    For the abstract this leads to: http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/rt/printerFriendly/#/# - a version in a popup    For the pdf this leads to: http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/article/download/#/# - the numbering on the downloaded file may     not match the two numbers in the URL!Supplementary info    Did not find anyCitation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)    Available via form selection in a popup from a "How to cite item" link      http://interpersona.psychopen.eu/rt/captureCite/#/# (the 2nd number might be 0, not the number of the pdf)      about 10 different formats. We will get the selection url from the html pages. To get the various citations, we will      have to use form processing sw.        We will not need this for our metadata since that is available elsewhere.Reference files  n/a     Audio or Video?  n/aImages, Figures & Tables    The only images I found were pictures in the TOC and on an article abstract page. I found no examples of full text html.    Here are two TOC's that had images:    http://ejop.psychopen.eu/issue/view/21 (TOC) and http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/view/220 (abstract)    The images lived at:      http://ejop.psychopen.eu/public/journals/1/cover_article_220_en_US.jpg      http://ejop.psychopen.eu/public/journals/1/cover_article_233_en_US.jpg    and in another journal: http://psyct.psychopen.eu/issue/view/5 PSYCT 2012 (V5, 2 issues) - 2013      http://psyct.psychopen.eu/public/journals/1/cover_article_10_en_US.png     I didn't find any other examples of figures/tables/images.DOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)  This publisher doesn't use DOI's in the URLS, but they list the doif for an article on the abstract page.  They look like this:a) http://dx.doi.org/10.5964/ijpr.v5i2.62b) http://dx.doi.org/10.5964/ejop.v6i4.226 c) http://dx.doi.org/10.5964/psyct.v5i1.1 Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.- stylesheets & supporting stuff live under   <base>/lib/pkp/styles  <base>/styles/  <base>/public/These all seem to be static, no issues with ajax.Alomst all page links live under the base_url (except for psychopen.eu, creativecommons &  purl.org))The crawl rules should restrict to just what we want. Areas we don't want are (and should keep out of crawl rules):<base>/about/<base>/pages/<base>/user<base>/issue/current (leads to current, which is changeable)<base>/issue/archive (leads to all)<base>/search/<base>/login/<base>/information<base>/index/--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------no indication that there are arguments at allwe might need to look at the form selection for citation collection----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------This site is pretty basic/clean.  I looked for, and didn't fnd any of the following:- no placeholders for ads and no ads on issue TOC/article page- no dates other than in title; no current date.  - volume/archive browsing is under /issue/archive (not in crawl rule)- No subscription identifier since this is open source- no next/prev (issue or volume)- no citing numbers or impact numbers-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------Even though the article URLs are opaque (no issue identifier) there don't appear to be cited by, referenced by or other cross-reference linksIt would be good to do a local crawl once the initial plugin is done to verify this.-----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/download/227/126  (which actually saves the file as: 227-210-1-PB.pdfDownloaded the same pdf on FF, Ch & Saf. No differences. No embedded datesAcrobat Pro showed that created/modified were static-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Lots of options here. 1) The metadata exists (and appears to be comprehensive) in the html meta tags on both the abstract and pdf landing page. It is available in both DC.* and citation_* format. (It includes the journal title but not the publisher)2) The metadata is available as a link to a page which is just an html page with a big table.   The publisher (PsychOpen) is listed here but would have to be parsed out3) The citation information is available via form page through selection for download. I'm not sure how to translate to a flat RIS URL.
