 * Iterates article files.  Archived source content zip files include files
 * with mime-type pdf and xml. The xml file contains the metadata and refers
 * to the name of the PDF file.
 * <p>
 * There's no way to consistently get the name
 * of the PDF file from the name of the XML file, so it's necessary to
 * iterate on the XML files and capture the name of the PDF files in the 
 * metadata extractor. Example XML file names include:
 * <pre>
 * 1/117966453266.3.zip!/ j.1365-2796.2009.02095.x.wml.xml
