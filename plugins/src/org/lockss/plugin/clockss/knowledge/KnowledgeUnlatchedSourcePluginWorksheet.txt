Here's the important parts for our needs:There is one record per named file<collection><record><controlfield>...</controlfield> there are a number of these. We ignore them<datafield tag="num" ind1="y" ind2="z">   <subfield tag="a">foo</subfield>   <subfield tag="b">bar</subfield></datafield>The files we get from Knowledge Unlatched have the following metadata we care aboutISBN:  df-tag="020", sf-tag="a"    This is a little complicated because there can be multiple of these fields blocks listed    one for each type of book (e-book, hardcover, paperback) and the formatting of the explanatory string,    if it's there, is inconsistent. In many cases, sf-tag="z" is used instead for alternate isbns.     I decided to take all isbn's that match the 20/a tag identifiers and have a     format of 13 valid isbn digits, even if there are multiple.  Usually the first one list is the    one we want.  If we don't get a valid isbn, we use the filename.BOOK TITLE: df-tag=245, sf-tag=a (title) sf-tag=b (subtitle)    Pick up title and subtitle if available. Clean of extra punctuation and white space so we can cleanly    format the "title : subtitle" layout. Titles also seem to sometimes have trailing "/" so remove those.DATE: df-tag=264, sf-tag=c    Pick up the publication date and clear away trail "." or enclosing "[]".  Most of the dates are in "yyyy"     format. One came in, bizarrely, as "Jun-14". For now, just let that one go through as is.PUBLISHER: df-tag=264, sf-tag=b    Original publisher (not Knowledge Unlatched). Remove trailing ","AUTHORS: several ways this can come in. I've supported those I found out about from the xsl but have only seen  df-tag="100", sf="a" or df-tag="700", sf="a"    Pick up the author in the given format "Last, First I." and remove any extra ",".    If there are multiples, put them in a metdata list, separated by ";"              My only concern is which publisher should be represented in the metadata database.   The way it is currently set up, K-U will have "0" count. We could hardwire k-u as the publisher. -----------------------TRIGGER PLAN--------------------------------------As per usual. A simple page with biblio information and a link to the pdf
