Name of publisher: National Academies PressRT:JIRA: PD-90Is this triggered content (no longer available from publisher)? noHow is this content delivered to us?RSYNC    Publisher puts files in to their outgoing site and we rsync the content over to our site daily    Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNameSourcePlugin) ClockssNAPBooksSourcePluginDoes this content represent BooksTDB information	 This is a standard Clockss child so the params are "base_url" and "year"    Base url:  Currently, staged on content5, this will ultimately get served fromclockss-ingest.lockss.org/sourcefiles/nap-releasedStart URL(s):nap-released/<ingest year>/Types of content:For a particular AU (usually, a year's worth of content), what types of files may be included	<filenumber>.stamped.pdf	<filenumber>.xml    How are these file types used:	The xml file with a name that matches the pdf provides the metadata for the pdf book.Naming convention if identifiable:	The number is arbitrary, but matches between the xml and pdfIs there anything in the AU directory that should NOT be collected?    Originally, NAP delivered a single metadata XML file called "metadata.xml" which was eternally increasing and     changed everytime a new book was added. We now exclude this file at the rsync level.Notes: Anything else worth noting about the source content?    The XML schema is NAP specific, but straightforward.----------------------SUBSTANCE DEFINITION--------------------------------------Which files in a directory define substance?	*.pdf    ------------------------ARTICLE ITERATION---------------------------------------Given the file types that may be provided for content, what is the map for contenttype to article target:	*.xml	find, parse, extract metadata, verify pdf exists for this content, emit    -----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------How is the publisher providing metadata for the content? We do not want to ingest sourcethat does not have accessible metadata. Scraping information out of a PDF file is not sufficient.	Use the SourceXmlMetadataExtractor framework using an NAP specific schema helper. The content	pulled from the XML file is as follows:   /book/record_id (number used as filename)/book/title & /book/subtitle - use a custom evaluator to combine/book/flat_isbn - isbn for book/book/display_date - yyyy-mm-dd /book/copyyear - yyyy, when display_date unavailable/book/author - semi-colon list of contributors, regardless of role    -----------------------TRIGGER PLAN---------------------------------------------    Create or modify a top level web page for triggered book titles associated with this publisher.Extract the article record for each triggered title with complete bibliographic information from the metadata database of the CLOCKSS box.Create an abstract page and a RIS citation file in a subdirectory specific to each triggered title.The abstract page contains a relative link to the access URL and the citation file. The page should also carry the metadata in Google Scholar and/or Dublin Core format. Add a link to the corresponding XML file indicated by the metadata URL on this page for documentation purposes.Add a link from the publisher specific triggered books TOC page to the newly created abstract page(s).
