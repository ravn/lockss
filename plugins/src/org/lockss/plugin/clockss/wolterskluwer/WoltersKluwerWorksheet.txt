-------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------
Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. 
Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. 
As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, 
filling in the answer to questions. Cut and paste specific URLs to support your 
notes and to allow subsequent readers to understand your analysis.

Base url: 
Where will we be serving the content from?:

Start URL(s):
How do we differentiate different AU's? For example, do we have year subdirectories below the base_url? Is the content in zip or tar files?

Types of content:
For a particular AU (usually, a year's worth of content), what types of files may be included
    eg: *.pdf, *.xml *.epub, *.mobi, *.jpg, etc
    
How are these file types used:
    eg: Each book has a <booknumber>.pdf with a corresponding <booknumber>.jpg of the cover
        There are also *.xml files that identify the metadata for all the books included in the directory

Naming convention if identifiable:
    eg: The files are a long number equivalent to the 2nd half of the DOI for the book, or
        The file names are a combination of author name and abbreviated article title, or
        The file name seems to be an arbitrary number

Is there anything in the AU directory that should NOT be collected?

Notes: Anything else worth noting about the source content?

----------------------SUBSTANCE DEFINITION--------------------------------------
Which files in a directory define substance?
    eg: *.pdf, but not *.xml
    
------------------------ARTICLE ITERATION---------------------------------------
Given the file types that may be provided for content, what is the map for content
type to article target:
    eg: <num>.pdf = FULL_TEXT_PDF; <num.jpg> = no target; etc
    
-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------
How is the publisher providing metadata for the content? We do not want to ingest source
that does not have accessible metadata. Scraping information out of a PDF file is not 
sufficient.
Does the publisher provide XML files with metadata?
  If so, does the XML file cover multiple books/articles or is there one XML file per item?
  Is the XML file in a specific industry standard format (eg ONIX for Books)?
  
  If it's straightforward, identify the XML format for basic metadata items (publisher, title, author)...
      eg:
          PUBLISHER: <Header><Publisher><PublisherName>XXXXX</PublisherName></Publisher></Header>
          TITLE: <Product><ItemID><Title>xxxx</Title></ItemID></Product>
          
If not in XML, how is the metadata provided (full text html, RIS files, etc)?
