---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: Berghahn BooksPublishing platform?:RT: 4630RU: 4648Is this triggered content (no longer available from publisher)? I don't think soHow is this content delivered to us?Push (the publisher uploads it to our ftp site)? from CoreSource    Schedule: unknown. We have the initial push    Do they deliver only incremental content or may there be repeat content: The numbers will be unique but I don't know      if by mistake there might be overlap if we get subsequent push deliveries.Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin)  ClockssBerghahnBooksSourcePluginClockss? [yes/no]:		YESGLN? [yes/no]:			PLN? [and name thereof]:Does this content represent Books? YESJournals? NO (Journals are ingenta)Other?TDB information  Same as other Clockss Source plugins    PARAMS - global; base_url    PARAMS - journal specific; year_name    ATTRS:Base url: TBD but probably http://clockss-ingest.lockss.org/sourcefiles/berghahn-released/ Where will we be serving the content from?:Is there a smaller development-only location for testing?:Start URL(s): If we differentiate AU by year of ingest:    http://clockss-ingest.lockss.org/sourcefiles/berghahn-released/2012 (etc)    Do we need to modify the existing directory structure under the base url for our purposes?   YES - The content delivered from CoreSource has a subdirectory Berghahn_Books which we        should probably just get rid of. No need for additional level. Types of content:For a particular AU (usually, a year's worth of content), what types of files may be included            *.pdf    *.epub    *.xml    *.jpg    How are these file types used:    Each book seems to have a <number>.pdf and a <number>.jpg     In some cases there is also a <number>.epub all represent the same ebook.    There are significantly less epub than pdf files. I'm not sure if we have any epub without corresponding pdf.    We will need to verify    The *.xml files contain metadata for the ebooks. There are several *.xml files but each file contains    information for more than one ebook and map the filename to its metadata.Naming convention if identifiable:    I believe the filname (number) is the ISBN-13 for the book (based on its use in the XML file).      We should be able to map this against the spreadsheet in addendum C from the RT.Is there anything in the AU directory that should NOT be collected?    *.md5sumNotes: Anything else worth noting about the source content?----------------------SUBSTANCE DEFINITION--------------------------------------Which files in a directory define substance?    We need the *.pdf to have content. *.epub would not be sufficient.    ------------------------ARTICLE ITERATION---------------------------------------Given the file types that may be provided for content, what is the map for contenttype to article target:    If they truly carry the same ISBN number, it will be easy to map *.pdf to corresponding    *.epub.      -----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------How is the publisher providing metadata for the content? We do not want to ingest sourcethat does not have accessible metadata. Scraping information out of a PDF file is not sufficient.Does the publisher provide XML files with metadata?     There are several *.xml files included in the delivery. These use the same XML format     as other CoreSource deliveries (ONIX for books?).
