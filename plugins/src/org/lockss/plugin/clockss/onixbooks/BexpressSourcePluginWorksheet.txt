---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: Business Expert PressPublishing platform?:RT: 3933RU: 4651Is this triggered content (no longer available from publisher)?How is this content delivered to us?Push (the publisher uploads it to our ftp site)? from CoreSource    Schedule: unclear -     Do they deliver only incremental content or may there be repeat content:Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) ClockssBusinessExpertPressSourcePluginClockss? [yes/no]:YES		GLN? [yes/no]:			PLN? [and name thereof]:Does this content represent Books? YESJournals?Other?TDB information - same as other Clockss source plugins    PARAMS - global; base_url    PARAMS - journal specific; year_name    ATTRS:Base url:TBD but possibly http://clockss-ingest.lockss.org/sourcefiles/bexpress-released/      but this is a little more complicated because there are two imprints - Business Expert Press and Momentum Press    do they have different base_urls or do we somehow differentiate below that level?Is there a smaller development-only location for testing?:Start URL(s):  Again - TBD; probably by year, based on when we receive the content    but again, we need to figure out how to handle the different imprint Do we need to modify the existing directory structure under the base url for our purposes?    YES - currently the content is loaded in to bexpress/ underneath is a Business_Expert_Press directory and a    Momentum_Press directory and the content lives under each of those. We need to decide whether to separate the    two in to two separate top directories (eg: bexpress/2012 & momentumpress/2012), etc   Types of content:For a particular AU (usually, a year's worth of content), what types of files may be included    *.pdf, *.jpg, *.xml    How are these file types used:        Theoretically there is one <number>.pdf and a matching <number>.jpg for each ebook. The jpg is the image of the cover    There are a number of .xml files each of which contains metadata for one or more ebooks    We have redundant XML files (eg Momentum_Press/Business_Expert_Press_-_Momentum_Press_Metadata_20121127104412.xml        represents the same records as Metadata_Only_Business_Expert_Press_-_Momentum_Press_Metadata_20130701030306.xml)Naming convention if identifiable:    The <number> filename corresponds to an ISBN-13 number for the bookIs there anything in the AU directory that should NOT be collected?    *.md5sumNotes: Anything else worth noting about the source content?----------------------SUBSTANCE DEFINITION--------------------------------------Which files in a directory define substance?        *.pdf    ------------------------ARTICLE ITERATION---------------------------------------Given the file types that may be provided for content, what is the map for contenttype to article target:    There is only the PDf as content. I'm not sure what target the *.jpg would    represent but we should at least collect and mark it. The tricky bit is getting     the metadata from the xml file.    -----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------How is the publisher providing metadata for the content? We do not want to ingest sourcethat does not have accessible metadata. Scraping information out of a PDF file is not sufficient.Does the publisher provide XML files with metadata?    As with all the other new Clockss source children, we need to get the metadata from the xml     file associated with the pdfs.
