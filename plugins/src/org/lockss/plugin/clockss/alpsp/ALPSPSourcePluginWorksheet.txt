Name of publisher: Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)Publishing platform?:RT: 5002RU: 4605Is this triggered content (no longer available from publisher)? No. The equivalent content is at:    http://www.alpsp.org/Ebusiness/ResearchPublications/ALPSPBookReports.aspxHow is this content delivered to us?Push (the publisher uploads it to our ftp site)?    Schedule: Original delivery of files on February 2013; plan to upload one or two as available ongoing.        Will email Michele when they do so?    Do they deliver only incremental content or may there be repeat content:        Unclear. The plan is to upload incrementally.  But what we have is not currently up         to date with the listing on the URL (above)Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) ClockssAssociationOfLearnedAndProfessionalPublishersSourcePluginClockss? [yes/no]: YES		GLN? [yes/no]: NO	PLN? [and name thereof]:Does this content represent Books? YES - majorityJournals? YES - 1 (theoretically) but not this is available in the source yetOther?TDB information- same as all other ClockssSourcePlugin children    PARAMS - global: base_url     PARAMS - journal specific: year_name    ATTRS:Base url: TBD but probably http://clockss-ingest.lockss.org/sourcefiles/alpsp-released/ Where will we be serving the content from?:Is there a smaller development-only location for testing?: Not necessary as it is not a huge set of contentStart URL(s):How do we differentiate different AU's? For example, do we have year subdirectories below the base_url?  We should probably do a per year subdirectory and track when we get new content delivered from the   publisher to be sure we don't duplicate content across year boundaries.  Do we need to modify the existing directory structure under the base url for our purposes?   YES - I think the directory for this publisher should be alpsp, not alps to better represent the   name of the publisher  Types of content:For a particular AU (usually, a year's worth of content), what types of files may be included            ONLY *.pdf, 1 per item (book, mostly)     Currently 19 items.    How are these file types used:                Each item is represented solely by one <name>.pdfNaming convention if identifiable:                Thefile name is some shortened version of the book or report title. For example:          Author_Perceived_ Quality_Characteristcs_ALPSPreport.pdf is          Author-perceived Quality Characteristics of STM Journals (2008)                    some pdf names have "+" or "_" or "-" in them.Is there anything in the AU directory that should NOT be collected?   Currently we have checksum <name>.md5sum files for each copied file. We don't want to preserve those   and ideally they would not even exist in the symlink treeNotes: Anything else worth noting about the source content?   No metadata available. We need to get this from the publisher.----------------------SUBSTANCE DEFINITION--------------------------------------Which files in a directory define substance?    eg: *.pdf, but not *.xml        <*>.pdf    ------------------------ARTICLE ITERATION---------------------------------------Given the file types that may be provided for content, what is the map for contenttype to article target:    only one file type, so not really an issue. must connect to metadata    -----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------How is the publisher providing metadata for the content? We do not want to ingest sourcethat does not have accessible metadata. Scraping information out of a PDF file is not sufficient.Does the publisher provide XML files with metadata?    no
