Crawl rules & Content Layout
Is there a predictable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? 
Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably 
only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are 
applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can 
generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.

  Each book has a few really necessary pages needed to preserve:
  the manifest page/start url and the associated PDF for the book are required!
  The main pages for the book are frames, which would frame
  sections/chapters of each book.  Each chapter is viewable within a frame.

Book Cover:

PDFPLUS
(May be called enhanced PDF. Look at a page - is it a PDF with active links or is it a 
PDF embedded within an html frame? Note this information)
The PDF is within an html frame - only a chapter available at a time, with a link
to "Next Chapter"
  Have not seen any hot links in any pdf 

PDF Landing Page
(This is a page with information on it with a link to the PDF or to allow download of the PDF. 
This may be the same as the abstract)
The main page/start url, as well as each chapter page has a link to download the PDF

Full text HTML
  The main page/start url is an html page, but does not have the book content in HTML, only PDF

Print friendly version option
  None

Supplementary info
  has (in the main frame) references, author bio and how to cite

Citation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)
  RIS file (download)

Reference files 
has reference information separated by chapter in text format with links to google scholar
and find in a library for the reference

Audio or Video?  NONE


Images, Figures & Tables
These items may exist in several formats, locations and with multiple access options.  First locate an 
article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an 
embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.

  Are there multiple size options? 
        book covers shown in multiple sizes, 
  Can it be opened in a popup?
  Does it open in its own page?
  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?
  Does it source from a different base url?
  
  I have not seen any tables/figures/images except as part of the pdf.  Since 
  all the content is only available via pdf, no (except cover and other stuff decorating
  home page) other images available.

DOI pattern
If this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the 
pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)

This DOI is used in the pdf URL (see above)
a) 10.1057/9780230554719
b) 10.1057/9781137031044
c) 10.1057/9781137283351

Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.

Addition Links to Include/Exclude
Now go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at 
all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  
Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded 
(that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.

Links to consider excluding
underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, citedby, servlet, searchId, etc
javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes 
date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).
  http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/busman2010/small/9780230244092_small.jpg
  There are a bunch of images like these (the ISBN does not match current book) that 
  are image advertisements for other books from the publisher.
  
outside images (twitter bird, institute logo) that have local copies under the base_url but would vary depending
on which machine is collecting ("Welcome Stanford University" with a copy of the Stanford logo - this 
image would get collected by default if it ended in ".jpg" but would not be collected by an Indiana machine
  No Stanford images noted, but we do not include links to reddit/pinterest/linkedin/etc, so should not collect their
  images (eg) http://www.palgraveconnect.com/view/images/icon_reddit.gif

Links to consider including
not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base  
underneath <base_url> and contains thins like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)

Does this site use automatically generated content?? 
View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:
__viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...
__eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...
These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.
  Have not seen evidence like this to indicate generated content

Notes
Anything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.

--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------
As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of 
your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be 
separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:
  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdf
whereas arguments that might be unnecessary might look like this
  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3n
These arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the 
arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.
Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)

----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------

Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. 
These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source 
to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  
Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find 
and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention.

 ------Look for these sorts of things. Remove this list and replace it with what you find---------
  Name and/or logo of subscriber institution
  Login identity in shopping cart area
  Copyright on page showing year
  Cited by section 
  Issue link which points to current issue
  Product price listing
  Footer section including adds or date
  Related content or related article search
  Impact factor or viewing count
  Session history

And if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:
<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification date
sfxlink javascript commands

Anything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??

  The html pages are well delineated into blocks: header, footer, right-column
  and content are clearly marked.  The extraneous blocks (everything but content)
  will be easy to hash out.
  <div id="constrain-header" class="cleared">
  <div id="constrain-content" class="cleared">
  <div class="column-width-sidebar column-r">
  <div id="constrain-footer" class="cleared">

-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------
If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal 
id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from. 
 deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf
 non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12
which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, 
write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those 
listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them.

 ------Look for these sorts of things. Remove this list and replace it with what you find---------
  Cited By Section - a link or section of links which point to articles that reference this article
  Corrigendum or Article Correction links
  Related Content or Related Articles
  Original Article (pointing back from a corrected article to the original)
  Prev Issue/Next Issue links
  Prev Article/Next Article links (sometimes these dead end at the ends of an issue, sometimes not)

  There are two sections in the right hand column that can be crawl-filtered out -
  (contains links to "Related Content" and "Recently Viewed") they're well defined,
  both in <div class="box-well">

-----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------
Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. 
Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date 
downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?
In Acrobat viewer look at the properties of the file. Is the date today's date? 
If so it's likely to be generated on the fly. 
If so, note the URL of the PDF you downloaded.
  http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/econfin2012/browse/inside/download/9781137283351.pdf
  has the current date (when viewed with adobe acrobat viewer) and the name of
  Stanford University
Now download the same PDF file a second time from a different browser (to ensure you're not getting cached version)
In a terminal window go to the directory that contain these two different versions of the same PDF file and run:
%diff -a pdf_version1.pdf pdf_version2.pdf
If there is a difference note that here and give the URL to the URL you tested.
  There are differences between the two pdfs (gathered on different days)

-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------
Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. 
For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of 
an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  
See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:

View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). 
You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.

View the page source and search for the following "<meta" 
there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.
  Only useful metadata available via <Meta> tag is the title
  
Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file 
(ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.  
  Can download a ris file: 
  http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/browse/citationExport?doi=10.1057/9781137283351&WT.cg_n=eBooks&WT.cg_s=Citation%20Export
  10.1057-9781137283351.ris that contains (for example):
  TY  - EBOOK
  AU  - Margolies, David
  CY  - Basingstoke
  DA  - 2014/06/05
  DO  - 10.1057/9781137031044
  PB  - Palgrave Macmillan
  PY  - 2012
  SP  - 192
  TI  - Shakespeare's Irrational Endings
  UR  - http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9781137031044
  SN  - 9781137031044
  ER  -
    
Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?
