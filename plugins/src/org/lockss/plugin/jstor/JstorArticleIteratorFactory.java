 * JSTOR limited plugin
 * This is a plugin that collects a limited set of content due to redirection.
 * We only pick up TOC and pdf (and in rare cases, full, media, select)
 * Based on information on the TOC page, we also engineer the RIS citation page
 * which is what we'll be using for metadata extraction and is therefore 
 * what we will iterate on.
 * Do a sanity check to make sure the actually have a content file associated 
 * with the engineered RIS url
