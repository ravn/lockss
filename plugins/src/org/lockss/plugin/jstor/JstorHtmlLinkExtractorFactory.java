/* Jstor needs its own LinkExtractor so that it can generate a link
 * for citation download from the DOI information stored on TOC pages.
 * Because the information is stored on the TOC page in a checkbox <input> tag
 * the html link extractor itself cannot do the work. It must use a custom
 * Jstor FORM element link extractor. 
 * This plugin version of the link extractor is needed to specify use of the 
 * custom HtmlFormExtractor which has the necessary custom FormElementLinkExtractor
 * 
 * This custom JsoupHtmlLinkExtractor could also be used to set up additional
 * restrictions for form processing but at least for now this isn't needed because
 * Jstor only allows us such limited crawling (because of redirection) that we
 * control the creation of the citation URLs anyway.
