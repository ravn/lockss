-------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, filling in the answer to questions. Cut and paste specific URLs to support your notes and to allow subsequent readers to understand your analysis.---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher:  American Public Health Association (now on Atypon platform)RT: 3813RU:  4315Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin)Clockss? [yes/no]:		NO (though manifest page has permission statement)GLN? [yes/no]:			YESPLN? [and name thereof]: Base url: (eg. http://www.pub-name.org/)(or does this vary by AU? If so, give multiple examples)    http://ajph.aphapublications.org/Start URL(s):  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/lockss/ajph/101/1/index.html (though exists for lockss as well)    One Journal_ID: ajph  Only ajph - not sure what volumes are now on Atypon (used to be highwire), as TDB only lists 101.  RU indicates that it is Atypon from 2011+  but the manifest page for Volume 99 (2009) leads to content that is "Powered by Atypon".... Is the permission page in a different location? If so, where?How does the permission statement work?     (eg. text on html page, creative commons license, license that shows up under certain conditions, single permission page)        permission statement is just written on manifest pagePick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) http://ajph.aphapublications.org/clockss/ajph/101/1/index.html  - only one. Supposedly only collecting 2011 and later on Atyponb)c)-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predicatable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.Journal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/loi/ajphVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/clockss/ajph/101/1/index.htmlIssue Table of contents  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/toc/ajph/101/11    NOTE: Atypon redirection problem seems to have been triggered when LOCKSS proxy is set - must get this fixed.        In the mean time I'll continue analysis without the proxy on       abs and pdf, etc all redirected to full version of articleAbstract  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198PDF  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198PDFPLUS(May be called enhanced PDF. Look at a page - is it a PDF with active links or is it a PDF embedded within an html frame? Note this information)  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198  it is a true pdf page, not pdf within an html framesetPDF Landing Page(This is a page with information on it with a link to the PDF or to allow download of the PDF. This may be the same as the abstract)  abstract or fullFull text HTML  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198Print friendly version option   nothing apparentSupplementary info  from article in Nov 2011 issue  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/suppl/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300211    landing page for several pieces of supplemental material, eg      http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/suppl/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300211/suppl_file/Mercer_2010443_App1.pdf      http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/suppl/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300211/suppl_file/Mercer_2010443_App2.pdf      http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/suppl/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300211/suppl_file/Mercer_2010443_App3.pdf      http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/suppl/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300211/suppl_file/Mercer_2010443_App5.pdf      Supplementary file 4 (REVISED) for Mercer et al AJPH 2011.xlsx      Citation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)   Goes to download citations landing page for this article:     http://ajph.aphapublications.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.2105%2FAJPH.2011.300211     with options to include "citation for this article" "references cited in this article" "article citation including abstract"     the first of which downloads a .ris fileReference files  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/ref/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300211     is abstract with reference listings at the bottom of the page. No links in amongst the references, so may not need to worry about leakingalso at the bottom of full text versions, eg:  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198    and this one had links, though in this case they all went away from the base_url so crawl rules would suffice, but probably need to be proactiveAudio or Video?   none that I sawImages, Figures & TablesThese items may exist in several formats, locations and with multiple access options.  First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.  Are there multiple size options?  Can it be opened in a popup?  Does it open in its own page?  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?  Does it source from a differnt base url?    http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198   javascript:popRef('tbl1')   so far I've found only tables, and these don't have other options for viewing other than getting shown in a pop up window. Need to figure out source location      this one, has a figure with optional other size for viewing;   http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2009.173872     javascript:popRef('fig1') also which is really http://ajph.aphapublications.org/action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=fig1&doi=10.2105%2FAJPH.2009.173872       in another small window.      "View larger version" on that popup page is:     http://ajph.aphapublications.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/apha/journals/content/ajph/2011/ajph.2011.101.issue-4/ajph.2009.173872/production/images/large/587fig1.jpeg     which is the likely location for all figures/tables/images:       <base_url>/na101/literatum/publisher/apha/journals/content/ajph/<YEAR>/<more identifying subdirectories>     DOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)a) 10.2105/AJPH.2009.173872b) 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198c) 10.2105/AJPH.2009.159723e (erratum)Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Addition Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, cityedby, servlet, searchId, etc  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).  Again this is likely to be in keeping with BaseAtypon    <base>/action/....  with the exception of showCitFormats, etc    <base>/page/...Links to consider including  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base    underneath <base_url> and contains thins like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)      This should be handled by BaseAtypon plugin crawl rules. But just as info.      css files all live under <base>/templates/....*.css   Does this site use automatically generated content?? View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.noNotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdfwhereas arguments that might be unnnecessary might look like this  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3nThese arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention.  Lots of ads, both on the TOC and the article pages  Left column has image of current issue cover  "Stanford Univ Med Ctr" in upper left hand  Most of left column is likely to change - specific to journal or publisher  Copyright date in footer And if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification datesfxlink javascript commandsAnything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from.  deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them.  ARTICLE:  NextArticle/PrevArticle seem to stop at issue boundaries  NextIssue/PrevIssue will get stopped by crawl rules    TABLE_OF_CONTENTS:  has "Original Article link when there is an Erratum piece in the issue which could lead out of AU (see: http://ajph.aphapublications.org/toc/ajph/101/11)  AND "Erratum" in the TOC listing vice versa-----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?In Acrobat viewer look at the properties of the file. Is the date today's date? If so it's likely to be generated on the fly. If so, note the URL of the PDF you downloaded.Now download the same PDF file a second time from a different browser (to ensure you're not getting cached version)In a terminal window go to the directory that contain these two different versions of the same PDF file and run:%diff -a pdf_version1.pdf pdf_version2.pdfIf there is a difference note that here and give the URL to the URL you tested.  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300203    No obvious time/date information in the Pdf and no differences between the safari saved version and the firefox saved version  True also for the equivalent pdfplus (which is indeed different than the pdf)-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.on abstract: http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300203dc.Titledc.Creatordc.Descriptiondc.Publisher "American Public Health Association"dc.Datedc.Typedc.Formatdc.Identifier 300203dc.identifier 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300203 (doi)dc.Sourcedc.Languagedc.Coverage    no obvious Journal Title in the metadata givenView the page source and search for the following "<meta" there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file (ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.  Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?
