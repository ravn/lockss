---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher:  American Public Health Association (now on Atypon platform)RT: 3813RU:  4315JIRA: PD-129 The analysis was done before this form existed. So this writeup is initially minimal but as a BaseAtypon child there is a huge amount of overlap. Documenting differences as they crop up Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) AmPublicHealthAssocPluginClockss? [yes/no]:		NO (though manifest page has permission statement)GLN? [yes/no]:			YESPLN? [and name thereof]: Base url: (eg. http://www.pub-name.org/)(or does this vary by AU? If so, give multiple examples)    http://ajph.aphapublications.org/Start URL(s):  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/lockss/ajph/101/1/index.html (though exists for lockss as well)    One Journal_ID: ajph  Only ajph - not sure what volumes are now on Atypon (used to be highwire), as TDB only lists 101.  RU indicates that it is Atypon from 2011+  but the manifest page for Volume 99 (2009) leads to content that is "Powered by Atypon".... Is the permission page in a different location? If so, where?How does the permission statement work?     (eg. text on html page, creative commons license, license that shows up under certain conditions, single permission page)        permission statement is just written on manifest pagePick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) http://ajph.aphapublications.org/clockss/ajph/101/1/index.html  - only one. Supposedly only collecting 2011 and later on Atyponb)c)-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predicatable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.Journal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/loi/ajphVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/clockss/ajph/101/1/index.htmlIssue Table of contents  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/toc/ajph/101/11    NOTE: Atypon redirection problem seems to have been triggered when LOCKSS proxy is set - must get this fixed.        In the mean time I'll continue analysis without the proxy on       abs and pdf, etc all redirected to full version of articleAbstract  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198PDF  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198PDFPLUS(May be called enhanced PDF.

First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.  Are there multiple size options?  Can it be opened in a popup?  Does it open in its own page?  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?  Does it source from a differnt base url?    http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198   javascript:popRef('tbl1')   so far I've found only tables, and these don't have other options for viewing other than getting shown in a pop up window. Need to figure out source location      this one, has a figure with optional other size for viewing;   http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2009.173872     javascript:popRef('fig1') also which is really http://ajph.aphapublications.org/action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=fig1&doi=10.2105%2FAJPH.2009.173872       in another small window.      "View larger version" on that popup page is:     http://ajph.aphapublications.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/apha/journals/content/ajph/2011/ajph.2011.101.issue-4/ajph.2009.173872/production/images/large/587fig1.jpeg     which is the likely location for all figures/tables/images:       <base_url>/na101/literatum/publisher/apha/journals/content/ajph/<YEAR>/<more identifying subdirectories>     DOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)a) 10.2105/AJPH.2009.173872b) 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198c) 10.2105/AJPH.2009.159723e (erratum)Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Addition Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, cityedby, servlet, searchId, etc  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).  Again this is likely to be in keeping with BaseAtypon    <base>/action/....  with the exception of showCitFormats, etc    <base>/page/...Links to consider including  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base    underneath <base_url> and contains thins like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)      This should be handled by BaseAtypon plugin crawl rules. But just as info.      css files all live under <base>/templates/....*.css   Does this site use automatically generated content?? View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.noNotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------Standard BaseAtypon----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------left column id is different-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from.  deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them.  ARTICLE:  NextArticle/PrevArticle seem to stop at issue boundaries  NextIssue/PrevIssue will get stopped by crawl rules    TABLE_OF_CONTENTS:  has "Original Article link when there is an Erratum piece in the issue which could lead out of AU (see: http://ajph.aphapublications.org/toc/ajph/101/11)  AND "Erratum" in the TOC listing vice versa   Exclude these using a nodeFilter accept() override. Look for:       On table of contents, the links have a 'class="ref ...."'       On article page, no class, but grandparent is <ul id="articleToolsFormat">       with identifying text of: 'Original Article', 'Original', 'Erratum', 'Errata'-----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Standard BaseAtypon-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Standard BaseAtypon     limited <meta> tags on html article page    form extraction from /action/showCitFormats page yields the downloadCitation url    from which we get the RIS data.
