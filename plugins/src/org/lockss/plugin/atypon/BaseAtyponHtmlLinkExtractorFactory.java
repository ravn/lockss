/* This will require daemon 1.62 and later for JsoupHtmlLinkExtractor support
The vanilla JsoupHtmlLinkExtractor will generate URLs from any forms that it finds on pages
without restrictions (inclusion/exclusion rules) and so long as those resulting URLs satisfy the crawl rules
they will be collected which is too broad because you can't know everything you might encounter. 
This is a thin wrapper that specifies what type of forms to INCLUDE to limit the potential collection.
