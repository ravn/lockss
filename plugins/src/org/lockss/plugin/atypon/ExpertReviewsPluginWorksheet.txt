Name of publisher: Expert Reviews (Atypon platform)RT:4699RU:4689Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) if a standalone plugin = ExpertReviewsPlugin (underneath BaseAtypon) butI think this should use the FutureSciencePlugin which should maybe be renamed to FutureScienceGroupPluginSummary: This is an Atypon plugin and should be made a child under BaseAtyponPlugin.Note that the online submissions link marks this as a part of the future-science-group. As I looked atthe hashing I was comparing it to the one written for FutureScience and it looks like these two could share a pluginas the underlying html is identical for equivalent sections.Clockss?

If so, where?How does the permission statement work? As per all Atypon plugins, the permission statement is text on the manifest page - separate for Clockss and LockssPick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) Expert Review of Vaccines: erv V8 (2009)  http://www.expert-reviews.com/clockss/erv/1/index.html b) Expert Review of Endocrinology & Metabolism eem V7 (2012) http://www.expert-reviews.com/clockss/eem/7/1/index.htmlc) Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy erc V2 (2004) http://www.expert-reviews.com/clockss/erc/2/1/index.html-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predicatable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.      This shoudl be an Atypon platform plugin so it will use the BaseAtyponPlugin for crawl rules.      Looking for exceptions to this while doing the analysis  Journal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)  http://www.expert-reviews.com/loi/ercVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)  http://www.expert-reviews.com/loi/ercIssue Table of contents  http://www.expert-reviews.com/toc/erc/2/3Abstract  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14779072.2.3.321PDF  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/pdf/10.1586/14779072.2.3.321PDFPLUS  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1586/14779072.2.3.321  this is a pdf, no framesetPDF Landing Page  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14779072.2.3.321Full text HTML  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/full/10.1586/eem.12.17Print friendly version option  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/pdf/10.1586/eem.12.17  this is just the pdf, for viewing or printingSupplementary info  <have not yet found any issue with supplementary info>Citation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)  On the right side of the page is a link "Download to Citation Manager) which is this link:  http://www.expert-reviews.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1586%2F14779072.2.3.321       leads to page that uses a button click for download of RIS format citationReference files  References are listed at the bottom of full text and pdf versions of the article with linksAudio or Video?  <have not found any yet>Images, Figures & Tablesin article:  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/full/10.1586/eem.12.17to view figure in a popup:  http://www.expert-reviews.com/action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=f1&doi=10.1586%2Feem.12.17to view larger version pull from true location:    http://www.expert-reviews.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/fud/journals/content/eem/2012/eem.2012.7.issue-3/eem.12.17/production/images/large/figure1.jpegThese items may exist in several formats, locations and with multiple access options.  First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there.

It can be helpful to know what the pattern is.

Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Addition Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding     pretty standard Atypon stuff and the crawl rules in the baseAtypon plugin should handle. Things under the base url that you don't want are like this:       action/showFeed?, showJournals, showpreferences, registration, showAlertSettings, recommendation, ssostart, dosSearch       page/SubmitArticle, authors.jps, librarians.jsp, advertisers.jsp, subscriptions.jsp, reprints.jsp, Permissions,           advertising,jsp, free_trial,jsp, supplements.jsp, fshelp.jsp. privacy.jsp, terms.jsp       search/...       feedback/...       userimages/ContentEditor...    atypon spider trap: www.expert-reviews.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/9999-9999.99999  Links to consider including  The style sheets live under <base_url>/templates but it doens't need to be explicitly crawled because  the first crawl rules includes anything under the base_url that ends in (among other things) .cssNotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------  Nothing jumped out at me here.  ----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention.  In particular I want to compare this with the html bits in FutureSciencePlugin because this is part of the Future Science Gruop  and if they're exactly the same then we could possibly just use that plugin. If not, this will have to be a separate  plugin for hashing but also an Atypon child.  Result: the html is identical for the equivalent sections. I think these two should share a plugin...    "Access provided by..." upper right    div class institutionBanner  "Welcome Stanford University..." right headline    span class identitiesName  Right column - "Quick links" "Quick Search"    td class quicklinks_content  Left column - "Resources", "Services", "Download/Links" - unnecessary and subject to change    <table style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 1px" class="sideMenu mceItemTable"  "Users who read this article also read"    div class full_text  "Cited by" (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.8.3.299)    div class citedBySection    TOC   occasional "free" and "CME" glifs next to some articles - may appear, disappear     (on: http://www.expert-reviews.com/toc/eem/7/3)   no obvious ads but check for placeholders in comments - YES     <!-- placeholder id=null, description=TOC Marketing Message -->-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------  Users who read this also read (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.8.3.299)   the formats available for those articles would also get crawled  "full" version of articles also list references (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/full/10.1586/14760584.8.3.299)    and there is concern that in the cases of other expert reviews articles they could leak. But it looks like they're all    contained within javascript popups and the abstract uses the dx.doi.org address so perhaps this doesn't need to get    crawl filtered though it probably could be just to be secure.      "Cited by" section will include direct links to other expert review articles    (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.6.3.357 - Expert Review of Vaccines in Cited By section)       Prev Article/Next Article stops links at each end of issue  Prev Issue/Next Issue in TOC will not cause problem because of crawl rules  -----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/pdf/10.1586/14760584.6.3.357    Downloaded over two days in Firefox, Chrome and Safari. diffs were all identical.  Opened file in Acrobat Pro and looked at properties - creation/modification date were original with  no other new information. Static pdf.-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:  http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.6.3.357    abstracts and full text have embedded html meta tags, though they aren't always complete for our purposes.   In this example we have:  dc.title, dc.Creator, dc.Subject, dc.Description, dc.Publisher, dc.Date, dc.Format, dc.Identifier  dc. Source, dc.Language, dc.Coverage, dc.Rights and keywords  but no journal title.    On each abstract/full text page there is also a link in the right column "Download to Citation Mnager"  which yields the URL:  http://www.expert-reviews.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1586%2F14760584.6.3.357  which has a button: <download article metadata>  which would download a RIS version of the metadata.  We can get this file as a URL using the form processing part of the daemon. It will be a URL of the form    http://www.expert-reviews.com/action/downloadCitation?doi=10.1586%2F14760584.6.3.357&format=ris
