-------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, filling in the answer to questions. Cut and paste specific URLs to support your notes and to allow subsequent readers to understand your analysis.---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) - an Atypon platform publisherRT: 3955RU: 4355Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) SiamPluginClockss? [yes/no]:		YESGLN? [yes/no]:			YESPLN? [and name thereof]: Base url: (eg. http://www.pub-name.org/)  http://epubs.siam.org/(or does this vary by AU? If so, give multiple examples)Start URL(s):    http://epubs.siam.org/(c)lockss/<JOURNALID>/<VOL#>/1/index.html        JOURNAL_IDs (at this moment):      mmsubt V1-11 (03-13)      jsaday V2-12 (03-13)      smjmap V64-74 (03-13)      smjcat V33-42 (03-13)      sjcodc V42-51 (03-13)      sjdmec V16-27 (03-13)      sjfmbj V1-4 (10-13)      sjisbi V1-6 (08-13)      sjmaah V35-45 (03-13)      sjmael V25-34 (03-13)      sjnaam V41-51 (03-13)      sjope8 V14-23 (03-13)      sjoce3 V25-35 (03-13)      siread V45-55  (03-13)      tprbau V47-57 (03-13)Is the permission page in a different location? If so, where?How does the permission statement work?     (eg. text on html page, creative commons license, license that shows up under certain conditions, single permission page) Permission statement is text on the manifest pagePick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) http://epubs.siam.org/clockss/mmsubt/10/1/index.html (journal_id = mmsubt; volume_name = 10)b) http://epubs.siam.org/clockss/siread/47/1/index.html (journal_id = siread; volume_name = 47)c) http://epubs.siam.org/clockss/sjfmbj/3/1/index.html (journal_id = sjfmbj; volume_name = 3)-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predicatable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.    This is an Atypon platform plugin so it will use the BaseAtyponPlugin for crawl rules.  Looking for exceptions to this while doing the analysisJournal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)  http://epubs.siam.org/journal/sjfmbjVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)  http://epubs.siam.org/loi/sjfmbjIssue Table of contents  http://epubs.siam.org/toc/sjfmbj/3/1Abstract  http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/110820658PDF  http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/110820658PDFPLUS(May be called enhanced PDF. Look at a page - is it a PDF with active links or is it a PDF embedded within an html frame? Note this information)  No pdfplus in any of the 3 journals that I looked at  Found ONE example by using "search" among all journals under this publisher:    http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdfplug/10.1137/0105010 (smjmap.1/5/3) WHY the .1 after the journal_id?? look at this further. Works even with just smjmap      all articles in this issue have pdfplus option - (pdf with links, not pdf in frameset)        but this isn't within our time block (1957) and the smjmap issues from V64-75 do not have pdfplus...    PDF Landing Page(This is a page with information on it with a link to the PDF or to allow download of the PDF. This may be the same as the abstract)   abstract has link to pdfFull text HTML  No full text in any of the journals I looked atPrint friendly version option  Supplementary info  Found an example under Siam Review V47, issue 4    http://epubs.siam.org/doi/suppl/10.1137/S0036144598339555 - leads to landing page with link:      http://epubs.siam.org/doi/suppl/10.1137/S0036144598339555/suppl_file/33955_01.tar.gz    Citation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)    Link in left column on article pages (abs, ref, suppl) "Download Citations"    http://epubs.siam.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1137%2FS0036144598339555           leads to page that takes Format selection (RIS, EndNote, BibTex, Medlars, RefWorks, RefWorks (China)       as well as selection for "Direct import"       and then a button click to "Download publication citation data"Reference files  http://epubs.siam.org/doi/ref/10.1137/S0036144598339555  Which looks like abstract but with reference information included towards bottom of page  Audio or Video?  none that I saw on this passImages, Figures & TablesThese items may exist in several formats, locations and with multiple access options.  First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.  Are there multiple size options?  Can it be opened in a popup?  Does it open in its own page?  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?  Does it source from a differnt base url?      Since I haven't been able to find a full text version, I haven't found any articles with separate images or tables DOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)a) 10.1137/100808174b) 10.1137/110820658c) 10.1137/S0036144503426074 (siread)Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Addition Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, cityedby, servlet, searchId, etc  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).Links to consider including  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base    underneath <base_url> and contains thins like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)      see note under "References" about accessing the downloadable content under action/showCitFormatsDoes this site use automatically generated content?? View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.    They do have this from ajax as a stylesheet - will we need it for proper display?? Because we won't be picking it up because of host url!  http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/yui/2.9.0/build/tabview/assets/skins/sam/tabview.css   (used on page http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0036144503426074)NotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdfwhereas arguments that might be unnnecessary might look like this  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3nThese arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention.  Name and/or logo of subscriber institution  Login identity in shopping cart area  Copyright on page showing year  Cited by section   Issue link which points to current issue  Product price listing  Footer section including adds or date  Related content or related article search  Impact factor or viewing count  Session history    Abstract:  "Your access to this publication is provided through the subscription of..."  "Stanford SUL" logo  "Session History" left column  "Related Databases", "Article Data" in right column - potential changes  "Recommend and Share" left column - they might add other options or remove some  Copyright date in footer  "Cited by" link at top near links to other format of article only appears if they article has been cited  "Citeb by" section at bottom of abs, ref, etc.    Table of contents:  "Find it SU" button after each article listing  "Browse Volumes" in left column will change over time as year changes  "F" glif for free article may appear or not as status of articles change  "| Cited 8 times" after article listing in TOC - will appear and change as this status changes  In source html there are ad placeholders - proactively remove theseAnd if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification datesfxlink javascript commandsAnything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from.  deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them.  "SessionHistory"  "Cited by" section  "References sections"  NextIssue/PrevIssue won't be a problem because of crawl rules  NextArticle/PrevArticle dead end at end of current issue - though we could be proactive     I used the search mechanism across journals to look for "errata, erratum, corrigendum and original article" to see if corrections  would provide a link back to the other (which might be in another AU).  I found no examples of them.  Corrections appeared to be self-contained   within their au. They referenced what they were correcting without a link.-----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?In Acrobat viewer look at the properties of the file. Is the date today's date? If so it's likely to be generated on the fly. If so, note the URL of the PDF you downloaded.http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0036144502409019    differed a lot between a firefox download and a safari download.  Even visually.     The safari view of the pDF had a line along the left margin that said: "Downloaded 6/10/13" along with copyright infoNow download the same PDF file a second time from a different browser (to ensure you're not getting cached version)    Viewing downloaded PDF in Acrobat Pro - the safari version has a current "Modified" date and more metadataIn a terminal window go to the directory that contain these two different versions of the same PDF file and run:%diff -a pdf_version1.pdf pdf_version2.pdfIf there is a difference note that here and give the URL to the URL you tested.HUGELY DIFFERENT- too much to copy in here. safari vs. firefox-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.on Abstract: http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0036144502409019  dc.Title  dc.Creator  dc.Subject  dc.Description  dc.Publisher "Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics"  dc.Date  dc.Type  dc.Format  dc.Identifier SIREAD000047000001000067000001  dc.Identifier 1.2450619  dc.Identifier SIREAD (journal_id)  dc.Identifier 40901  dc.Identifier 67_1.pdf  dc.Identifier 10.1137/S00036144502409019 (doi)  dc.Source  dc.Language  dc.Coverage  keywords  View the page source and search for the following "<meta" there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file (ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.  Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?
