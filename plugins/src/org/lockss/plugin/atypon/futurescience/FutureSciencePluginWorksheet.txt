-------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, filling in the answer to questions. Cut and paste specific URLs to support your notes and to allow subsequent readers to understand your analysis.---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: FutureScience (Atypon platform)Note that this is an Atypon platform plugin so in many cases it will simply rely on the BaseAtyponPlugin and the evalution in that directory.RT: RU:4595Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) FutureSciencePluginClockss? [yes/no]:		yesGLN? [yes/no]:			yesPLN? [and name thereof]: Base url: (eg. http://www.pub-name.org/) http://www.future-science.com(or does this vary by AU? If so, give multiple examples)Start URL(s):Atypon plugins follow the same pattern, which is <base_url>/(c)lockss/<journal_id>/<vol#>/1/index.htmlwhere the 1 is actually an issue number, but 1 is assumed to exist.Journal ids for this publisher are as follows:bio: vol 1-5 (2009 - 2013)bfs: vol 1-4 (2010 - 2013)cmt: vol 1-4 (2010 - 2013)cli: vol 1-3 (2011 - 2013)fmc: vol 1-5 (2009 - 2013)pbp: vol 1 (2013)ppa: vol 1-2 (2012 - 2013)tde: vol 1-4 (2010 - 2013)Is the permission page in a different location? If so, where?How does the permission statement work?     (eg. text on html page, creative commons license, license that shows up under certain conditions, single permission page)        permission statement is listed on the manifest page as visible textPick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) JID = tde; VOL 2; www.future-science.com/clockss/tde/2/1/index.htmlb) JID = fmc; VOL 4; www.future-science.com/clockss/fmc/4/1/index.htmlc) JID = bio; VOL 1; www.future-science.com/clockss/bio/1/1/index.html-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predictable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.Journal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)  http://www.future-science.com/loi/tdeVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)  http://www.future-science.com/clockss/tde/2/1/index.htmlIssue Table of contents  http://www.future-science.com/toc/tde/2/1Abstract  http://www.future-science.com/doi/abs/10.4155/tde.10.103PDF  http://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.4155/tde.10.103PDFPLUS(May be called enhanced PDF. Look at a page - is it a PDF with active links or is it a PDF embedded within an html frame? Note this information)  http://www.future-science.com/doi/pdfplus/10.4155/tde.10.103 (pdf, not frameset)PDF Landing Page(This is a page with information on it with a link to the PDF or to allow download of the PDF. This may be the same as the abstract)  abstract or full textFull text HTML  http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/tde.10.77Print friendly version option  pdf versionSupplementary info  http://www.future-science.com/doi/suppl/10.4155/bio.09.12 (from bio vol 1, iss 1) - landing page  http://www.future-science.com/doi/suppl/10.4155/bio.09.12/suppl_file/fig1.pdbCitation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)  http://www.future-science.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.4155%2Fbio.09.88      hitting button downloads .ris fileReference files     hitting reference number does javascript:popRef() call on the reference item in the article     which opens popup with basic reference info and links out to other outside sites with information (CrossRef, Medline, CAS)            javascript:popRef()       javascript:popRef2()       javascript:popRefLink()Audio or Video?    didn't find any in this pass - doesn't mean it doesn't exist     Images, Figures & TablesThese items may exist in several formats, locations and with multiple access options.  First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.  ultimately the image lives at:        http://www.future-science.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/fus/journals/content/bio/2009/bio.2009.1.issue-6/bio.09.88/production/images/large/graphic2.jpeg      As in most Atypon sites, the images/tables/data live under         <base_url>/na101/home/literatum/publisher/<PUBID>/journals/content/<JOURNAL_ID>/....      in this case the PUBID = "fus", the JOURNALID matches that for the manifest page and the underlying content location is:        <year>/<jid>.<year>.<vol>.issue-<issue>/then article identification  Are there multiple size options?    yes - larger size opens directly from source site (literatum)  Can it be opened in a popup?      hitting image calls action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=f2&doi=10.4155%2Fbio.09.88  Does it open in its own page?  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?  Does it source from a differnt base url?   no        table example: http://www.future-science.com/action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=T1&doi=10.4155%2Ffmc.12.176DOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)a) 10.4155/bio.09.87 (10.4155/<jid>.<vol>.?? - the last bit might be unique article identifier. It isn't related to page num)b) 10.4155/tde.11.82c) 10.4155/fmc.12.173    NOTE - the middle bit, the number is NOT the volume. For example Bioanalysis V4 has numbers like this:      10.4155/bio.12.15 and 10.4155/bio.11.333 both of which are from March 2012 or V4, Issue 5. Go figure.      This is why we can't be to exclusive with DOI patterns.Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Additional Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, cityedby, servlet, searchId, etc  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).     pretty standard Atypon stuff and the crawl rules in the baseAtypon plugin should handle. Things under the base url that you don't want are like this:       action/showFeed?, showJournals, showpreferences, registration, showAlertSettings, recommendation       page/SubmitArticle, authors.jps, librarians.jsp, advertisers.jsp, subscriptions.jsp, reprints.jsp, Permissions,           advertising,jsp, free_trial,jsp, supplements.jsp, fshelp.jsp. privacy.jsp, terms.jsp       search/...       feedback/...       userimages/ContentEditor...Links to consider including  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base    underneath <base_url> and contains thins like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)      pretty standard Atypon stuff          need to figure out (true for all) how to access the reference information that is from a form download accessed through action/showCitFormats?... pageDoes this site use automatically generated content?? View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.        I do not belief so. css files seem standard under templates/jspNotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdfwhereas arguments that might be unnnecessary might look like this  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3nThese arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention.    ABSTRACT page:     "Access provided by Stanford University" upper right     "Welcome Stanford University" above top bar     "Users who read this article also read" section     Quick links box right hand side has "related articles" chunk     Left column has list of journals which can change over time     "Cited by" section            TOC page:     Various ad locations     some articles have a "free" glif - might change status over time          And if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification datesfxlink javascript commands      citedBy and references don't seem to have "find it at Stanford" as some others doAnything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from.  deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them.    CitedBy section on abs, ref, full  References section      In either of these cases, when the cited/referenced article is also from future-science, you will crawl out of this AU and onward  SessionHistory in left hand column    Note - nextIssue/prevIssue  on the TOC aren't a problem because even though the links will cross volumes, the crawl rules will keep you from following link       in to a new volume (since TOC urls *are* deterministic)       prevArticle/nextArticle terminate at the edges of issues so won't overcrawl this way       -----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?In Acrobat viewer look at the properties of the file. Is the date today's date? If so it's likely to be generated on the fly. If so, note the URL of the PDF you downloaded.Now download the same PDF file a second time from a different browser (to ensure you're not getting cached version)In a terminal window go to the directory that contain these two different versions of the same PDF file and run:%diff -a pdf_version1.pdf pdf_version2.pdfIf there is a difference note that here and give the URL to the URL you tested.    http://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.4155/bio.09.146       downloaded both on firefox and safari, no difference noted with diff command       also same result with pdfplus version of document-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.  http://www.future-science.com/doi/abs/10.4155/bio.09.146 as well as   http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/bio.09.146    dc.Title  dc.Creator  dc.Description  dc.Publisher "FutureScience Ltd London, UK  dc.Date  dc.Format  dc.Identifier "10.4155/bio.09.146" (doi)  dc.Source (dx.doi.org url)  dc.Language EN  dc.Rights    NOTE - no Journal Title!! We will have to get this somehow for metadata extraction to be successful        some Atypon sites have multiple dc.Identifier one of which can be parsed for Journal Title, but obviously that cannot be counted on  View the page source and search for the following "<meta" there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file (ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.    The RIS data is downloadable. But requires a button click. Need to figure out how to access this. It does have Journal Title (T2, JF, JO)  Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?
