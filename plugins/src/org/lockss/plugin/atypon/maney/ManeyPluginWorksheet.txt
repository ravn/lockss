Journal of Adult Theological Education is still on metapress       www.manyonline.com/loi/ate       and others in humanities and social sciencesMANEY on ATYPON file types & URL pattern:   http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/full/<doi1st>/<doi2nd> : full text html as available   http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/<doi1st>/<doi2nd> : abstract    http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/pdfplus/<doi1st>/<doi2nd> pdf version   http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/ref/<doi1st>/<doi2nd> references      The issue TOC also may have a "preview" link which just expands the text on the TOC page to include the summary of the article      abstract, references & full text are each their own URL but they appear on the page as tabs on a single article landing page   figures/tables - the url for these appears as an anchor on the full text version of the article but pop up a window with        navigation from table to table. This can be accessed from the article landing page or the TOC     http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0729247313Z.00000000023#allImages          References live in their own tab (really, a unique URL) but also have information for in-line popup as the viewer floats over the      reference link. Citation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)   This is accessed from a link from any article landing page (abs/full/ref).    The link leads to a form for selecting type of citation.    We must process this and get all the options (ris, bibtex) except refworks. We will get metadata from the RIS citation version.      The link is in the right hand column "Export citation".    www.maneyonline.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=<doi1st>/<doi2nd>    Images, Figures & Tables  A link from the TOC or the article landing page is an anchor on the full text URL, but actually pops up a navigable window overlay:  http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0729247313Z.00000000023#allImages     which is the figure viewer (in-line links also go to the images/figures)     javascript:void(0);       Once in the image viewer, there is a link to "Larger image" which goes to:    http://www.maneyonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/maney/journals/content/war/2013/war.2013.32.issue-3/0729247313z.00000000023/production/images/large/war-32-03-183-f03.jpegDOI patterna)10.1179/0076609712Z.0000000003 (medieval archaelogy)b)10.1179/1557069X11Y.0000000005 (deafness & education international)c)10.1179/0590887613Z.00000000026 (costume)Does this site use automatically generated content??     no obvious ajax or generated css or javascript files    although the css has an argument that may identify time/date stamp:  "/pb/css/head_3_8.css?1397594718000"    but taking off the argument still gets the file, so normalize off the argument    NotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.- EXCLUDED:    <base_url>/userimages/####/banner (etc)        Atypon publishers make a local copy of outside organizations logos for use. They don't        end in the usual suffixes (.jpg, etc) so they aren't collected, but this is okay because        some of the images are specific to the viewer - that is, a Stanford Logo for "Welcome Stanford        University" and so the URLs wouldn't be on all collecting boxes. Just ignore and let them        get excluded    <base_url>/doi/citedBySection/<doi1st>/<doi2nd>        Many uses this new URL format for a citedBySection - we already crawl & hash filter anything        in this section, but I was told not to collect it either.         - INCLUDED     <base_url>/resources/page-builder/font/font_*.eot, or .woff, or .ttf, or .svg        font formats - add the suffixes to the Atypon base crawl rules                   URL NORMALIZATION:     <base_url>/pb/css/head_3_8.css?1397594718000     Some of the CSS files (probably due to PageBuilder, see URL) have what looks to be a hash      argument after the filename probably for versioning. You can get the file without the argument,     so normalize off the argument - probably BastAtypon        --------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------Atypon -Normalize the arguments used in the citation download so that you can guess at the URL in the article iterator.The BaseAtypon url normalizer can do this. It should become the format:    http://www.maneyonline.com/action/downloadCitation?doi=<doi>&format=ris&include=cit    where format can be ris, bibtex, medlars, endnote, refworks and refworks-cn      we need to exclude refworks & refworks-cn... must look in to whether we want any other than bibtex and ris      normalize off the anchors (but this happens automatically) to avoid duplicated URLsnormalize off the css file argument (see "/pb/css/head_3_8.css?1397594718000" above)        ---------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------Atypon things that usually need hash filteringheader section in htmlheader of body content - top area with search, logo, etcfooter of body content - bottom area with copyright, etcseemingly automatically generated file names in htmlIn main body content:    article landing page        citation counter/cited by        reference link showing access - eg.

References        Found an article that references another article in the same journal:        http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/ref/10.1179/2045772313Y.0000000128 (which is Vol36(4))        reference #87 references V34(3)        but it does not appear to have any direct link to article URL except for DOI outside location    Again, safer to crawl filter the tab.    in-line references do not appear to have live links 3.errata/corrigenda/original article    Most of the corrections were handled as their own article without links to anything    other than the outside DOI link - but I found at least one:    http://www.maneyonline.com/toc/his/37/1        this TOC has an article "Corrigendum" which has a link to "Original Article"        which is from V35/issue1    and that article abstract has a link:        "View correction published for this article"    and the corrigendum abstract has:        "Original Article" link  which will need to be crawl-filtered4-7. no session history or also read or related content other than the search box8. prev/next at article level stop at issue boundary   prev/next at issue level will get stopped by crawl rule on URL pattern                -----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Looks okay - no filtering needed-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Use ris citation file if thereFallback to html information on abstract file
