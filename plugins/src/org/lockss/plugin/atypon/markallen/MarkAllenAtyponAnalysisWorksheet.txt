This analysis worksheet is for the use of Atypon platform publishers. 
We are assuming that the plugin will be a child of BaseAtypon.

At the bottom of this file is a listing of URLS for articles at all the current Atypon child sites.
Use this for quick cut-and-paste access to comparison pages.
They are grouped for sites that show similarity.

This assumes the following:
Each journal served by the plugin will have 3 parameters - base_url, journal_id & volume.

MANIFEST: <base_url>/clockss/<jid>/<vol>/index.html
TOC: <base_url>/toc/<jid>/<vol>/<issue>
ARTICLE URLS (some or all of): 
    <base_url>/doi/abs/<doi_1st>/<doi_2nd>
    <base_url>/doi/full/<doi_1st>/<doi_2nd>
    <base_url>/doi/pdf/<doi_1st>/<doi_2nd>
    <base_url>/doi/pdfplus/<doi_1st>/<doi_2nd>
     ....and others that should be collected

------------------------------------------------------------------
As  you do your analysis, you should only have to look at the following potential issues. 
The rest should be handled by the BaseAtypon parent.

---------------------CRAWL FILTERING-----------------------------
For crawl filters, remember to limit the exclusion to the smallest chunk of html possible
You will probably have to create a <plugin>HtmlCrawlFilter.java, but if at ALL possible, 
extend BaseAtyponHtmlCrawlFilter and just add any missing pieces.

Go through the following list and make sure that each of the following sites for overcrawling are handled

TOC pages:
Because we get to issue TOC pages from the manifest page, we don't need other ways to travel

1)next/prev issue
  BaseAtypon handles:
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div", "id", "nextprev"),
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div", "id", "prevNextNav"),

2) listing of ALL volumes/issues which would allow access to other issues in this volume
  BaseAtypon handles:
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("ul", "class", "volumeIssues"),

ARTICLE pages:
1) next/prev links (to avoid bleed if we can't avoid an overcrawl to an article outside the AU)
  BaseAtypon handles these variations:
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("a", "class", "articleToolsNav"),
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttributeRegex("td", "class", "journalNavRightTd"),
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttributeRegex("td", "class", "journalNavLeftTd"),

2) breadcrumb with live link back to TOC
  BaseAtypon handles:
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div", "id", "breadcrumbs"),
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttributeRegex("ul", "class", "^(linkList )?breadcrumbs$"),

3) Direct link back to the TOC
   BaseAtypon does not handle this. An example can be found in AIAAHtmlCrawlFilterFactory

4) Link to original article (if this is correction) or vice versa
  BaseAtypon handles:
     any link tag with the text that contains (case-insensitive) the regexp "Original Article|Corrigendum|Correction|Errata|Erratum"

5) Cited by section
  BaseAtypon handles:
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div", "class", "citedBySection"),

6) Any other sections with links to other in-publisher articles, eg
     session viewed
     related content
     articles commenting on this one
     reference sections links (some may be within this publisher)
     in-line reference links (some may be within this publisher)
     users also read
     most read
     most cited
 
* from toc, panel ad under pageHeader has link to other issue
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/toc/bjom/21/10
     
* most read
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/full/10.12968/bjom.2013.21.10.688

* from abs and full text - middle column 
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjom.2013.21.10.701
  all article tools except Download Citations

7) CAREFUL - you must be sure NOT to exclude the link that points to the "download citation information".
If it lives within a column you otherwise don't need, use the HtmlNodeFilters.allExceptSubtree() method
   
* logo leads to current toc
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/toc/bjom/21/10
    
---------------------HASH FILTERING-----------------------------
The other section that is almost guaranteed to require some plugin specific code.
Some publishers are truly unique, but MOST of them fall in to one of 3 types.  Check out some existing 
plugins for similar words (eg "listeratumAd" vs "type-ad-placeholder" and you will probably find a plugin that
is very similar to yours and will be a good source for ideas.  
Aim for maximal filtering
Ideally, extend the BaseAtypon hash filter - there are two ways to use it - with or without whitespace filtering.


What BaseAtypon does:
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div", "id", "header"),
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div", "id", "footer"),
    new TagNameFilter("script"),
    HtmlNodeFilters.commentWithRegex(".*"),  // should use HtmlNodeFilters.comment(),
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("a", "class", "sfxLink"),
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("link", "rel", "stylesheet"),

Thinks to look for:
1) access_icon usage on TOC pages 
   BaseAtypon does
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttributeRegex("img", "class", "^accessIcon"),

2) Citation listings
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div", "class", "citedBySection"),

3) Size note after PDF and PDF Plus 
    HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("span", "class", "fileSize"),
    And in transform() that just uses a regexp on the text: "PDF\\s?(Plus)?\\s?\\(\\s?[0-9]+"

4) left column and/or right column
5) Look for both ads AND ad placeholders (which may get filled in later for announcements)
   such as something like:
        HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttribute("div",  "class", "mainAd"),
        HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttributeRegex("div", "class", "widget type-ad-placeholder"),
        HtmlNodeFilters.tagWithAttributeRegex("section", "class", "^widget literatumAd"),
6) Section pull down menus - sometimes in full-text versions of the article there are pull down menus that let you go to the different sections (figures, references, introduction).  These menus will ADD a "citations" to the drop down once there are some.
7) TOC - may have increasing citation counts next to each article listing, once they've been cited

* top page ad and all other ads with class LiteratumAd
* institution banner
* pageHeader
* pageFooter
* panel ad under pageHeader has link to other issue
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/toc/bjom/21/10
* for toc - social media
* from toc - accessIconContainer 
* middle column ad of an article - all article tools with 
  class literatumArticleToolsWidget except Download Citations
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjom.2013.21.10.701
* abs, full text and ref right column - most read 
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/full/10.12968/bjom.2013.21.10.688
* full text right colummn - several locations with ids
  http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/full/10.12968/bjom.2013.21.10.688
* Downloaded count from full text.

---------------------LINK EXTRACTOR-----------------------------
The BaseAtypon link extractor does two primary things - it generates the links on the "download citations" form so that we get the citations (RIS) and it generates the links needed to pick up the alternate sizes for the images. 

1) CITATION DOWNLOAD
Somewhere on your abstract or full text article page there will be a link with "download citation" or the equivalent. This link will be a url like this: <BASE_URL>/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.2217%2Fwhe.11.79.  This page (which we collect) provides a form for downloading citation information in any or all of the following permutations:

formats: ris, bibtext, endnote, refworks, refworks-cn
citation choice: citation only, with abstract, with references.
Some only give you one button/one choice; some give you radio button choices.

BaseAtypon handles them all. Your plugin might need to add an additional restriction if (for example) the form allows you the option of direct download (eg a "direct" checkbox).  See SiamHtmlLinkExractor as an example

2) Alternate Image access
There seem to be 4 primary ways in which additional image sizes are presented to the reader. 
1 - old school; the image options are actual links on the page. We collect these through crawling. See Taylor&Francis
2 - javascript:popRef('F1')
    which generates: BASE/action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=F1&doi=10.2466%2F05.08.IT.3.3...
3 - javascript:popRefFull('i1520-0469-66-1-187-f03')
    which generates BASE/action/showFullPopup?id=i1520-0469-66-1-187-f01&doi=...
4 - Javascript:void(0)
    This one is harder to recognize because the href on the image which brings up the viewer is just the above. But look in the
    page source for:
      window.figureViewer={...}
    This is an array of information that will be used by the viewer to present the alternate images. 
    BaseAtypon will handle this as soon as we have 1.67 functionality.  See Maney, BiR, and AiAA

* images handled by BaseAtypon:
<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef('_i2')">
<img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mag/journals/content/bjom/2013/bjom.2013.21.issue-10/bjom.2013.21.10.746/20130930/images/small/bjom.2013.21.10.746_f01.gif" align="bottom" border="1" alt="" id="_i2image"><br>
<strong>View larger version</strong>(145K)<br><br></a>

-------------------------PDF FILTERING-----------------------------

Most Atypon plugins seem handled jsut fine by the default "BaseAtyponPdfFilterFactory"
There are two (currently) that need to instead use the "BaseAtyponScrapingFilterFactory" because they have PDFPlus versions of the articles that contain growing lists of references.  
For an example, look at
  http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.2466/05.08.IT.3.3
   and then go to the 3rd to last page (references) and note that many of the refrences have a little arrow that acts as a pulldown menu showing where the reference article can be found. These link lists change over time. 

Note that if you need to use the scraping filter, you also need to be sure that the size information (eg "PDF Plus (237 KB)") on the TOC and possibly article page must be hashed as well. BaseAtypon probably handles this, but check.

* pdfplus contains growing list with a little triangle arrow:
http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/pdfplus/10.12968/bjom.2013.21.10.692
* it looks like BaseAtyponHtmlHashFilterFactory does hash out the size text of
pdfplus "PDF Plus (237 KB)"
* downloaded http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/pdf/10.12968/bjom.2013.21.10.692 on 22oct2014
and 24oct2014, did "diff -au" and they are identical. So no pdf filter needed current.
However, it's possible this will change in the future like the case of SEG and Endocrine Society.
 
-------------------------DONE-----------------------------

And with that, your plugin is probably 95% of the way done.  
Please take note of any new features because they may indicate a cross-platform change.

-------------------------COMPARISON-----------------------------

Use cut-and-paste with the following URLS to see where your new site is similar to other sites.
This can help you identify plugin needs by looking at the most similar children.

Each of these links takes you to a representative full-text-html page, from which you can 
easily navigate to the T.O.C. or other aspects of the article.

Similarities Notes:
    
Image Viewers: 
    Old Style (in-line showPopup): T&F, BioOne
    popRef: Ammons, APHA, BQ, FutureScience, Edinburgh
    popRefFull: AMetSoc, ASCE, SEG, 
    ShowFigures:  AIAA, BiR, Maney, Endocrine
    ??Ajax??: NRC
   (Siam - couldn't find any full-text html articles, no image viewer)

Similarities in underlying HTML, though not identical - clearly a similar base.
    AIAA, AMetSoc, APHA, Ammons, 
         use of articleToolsNav, nextPrev on TOC
    ASCE, SEG, Siam
         as above, use articleToolsNav, but also prevNextNav on TOC
    BiR, Maney, Endocrine
        see use of "widget literatum..." in many section tags; use of journalNav
    Relatively unique - FutureScience, NRC, BioOne, BQ, T&F
